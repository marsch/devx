# API Analytics and Monitoring System

## Description
Implement a robust analytics and monitoring system that tracks API usage, performance metrics, and provides insights to both API providers and consumers.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Real-time monitoring of API health and performance
- Collection of usage metrics (requests, errors, latency, etc.)
- Customizable dashboards for visualizing API analytics
- Alerting system for performance degradation or unusual activity
- Historical data storage and trend analysis
- API usage reporting by consumer, endpoint, and time period
- Export functionality for analytics data

## Technical Notes
- Implement a time-series database for efficient storage of metrics
- Design a scalable architecture that can handle high volumes of metrics data
- Use asynchronous processing for analytics to minimize impact on API performance
- Implement data retention policies for long-term storage
- Ensure privacy compliance in data collection and storage

## Dependencies
- API Management system
- Authentication system for identifying API consumers
- Database for storing analytics data
- Notification system for alerts

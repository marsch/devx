# API Authentication System

## Description
Implement a secure authentication system for the developer portal that allows API consumers to register, obtain API keys, and authenticate their requests.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Users can register for an account on the developer portal
- Users can generate and manage API keys
- The system supports multiple authentication methods (API keys, OAuth 2.0, JWT)
- Rate limiting and throttling mechanisms are in place
- Secure storage of authentication credentials
- Audit logging for authentication events

## Technical Notes
- Use industry-standard encryption for storing sensitive information
- Implement token-based authentication with appropriate expiration policies
- Design the system to be scalable to handle high volumes of authentication requests

## Dependencies
- User management system
- Database for storing credentials
- Security infrastructure

# Modern Open-Source Developer Portal for External APIs - Development Plan

This directory contains the development plan for building a modern open-source developer portal for external APIs. The plan is organized into user stories, broken down by component area, to facilitate a structured approach to development.

## Project Overview

The Modern Open-Source Developer Portal aims to provide a comprehensive platform for API providers to expose their APIs to external developers in a user-friendly, interactive, and well-documented manner. The portal includes features for API discovery, documentation, testing, authentication, and analytics.

## Directory Structure

The user stories are organized into the following component areas:

- **Backend**: Server-side components that handle API management, authentication, user management, and analytics
- **Frontend**: Client-side components that provide the user interface for developers to interact with the portal
- **DevOps**: Infrastructure, deployment, and operational components
- **Design**: UI/UX components and design system
- **Documentation**: API documentation system and developer guides

## Development Sequence

The recommended development sequence is as follows:

1. **Foundation Phase**
   - Backend: User Management System
   - Backend: API Authentication System
   - DevOps: Infrastructure as Code
   - Design: Design System

2. **Core Functionality Phase**
   - Backend: API Management System
   - Frontend: Developer Dashboard
   - Frontend: API Documentation Interface
   - Documentation: API Documentation System

3. **Enhanced Features Phase**
   - Backend: Analytics & Monitoring System
   - Frontend: Interactive API Explorer
   - Documentation: Developer Guides and Tutorials
   - DevOps: CI/CD Pipeline

4. **Refinement Phase**
   - Design: UI/UX Component Library
   - Performance optimization
   - Security hardening
   - Accessibility improvements

## Contributing

Each user story is designed to be an independent unit of work that can be assigned to a developer or team. The stories include acceptance criteria, technical notes, and dependencies to guide implementation.

When implementing a user story, please refer to the dependencies section to ensure that prerequisite components are in place before beginning work.

# Infrastructure as Code

## Description
Implement Infrastructure as Code (IaC) practices to automate the provisioning and management of all infrastructure components required for the developer portal.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Complete infrastructure defined in code (compute, storage, networking, etc.)
- Environment parity across development, staging, and production
- Automated infrastructure provisioning and updates
- Self-healing infrastructure capabilities
- Scalability configurations for handling varying loads
- Disaster recovery procedures and backup strategies
- Security configurations and compliance controls
- Monitoring and logging infrastructure
- Cost optimization strategies
- Documentation for infrastructure components

## Technical Notes
- Implement using modern IaC tools (Terraform, AWS CloudFormation, Pulumi, etc.)
- Design for multi-cloud or cloud-agnostic deployment where possible
- Implement state management for infrastructure changes
- Use modular design for reusable infrastructure components
- Implement proper error handling and rollback procedures
- Ensure secure handling of infrastructure secrets and credentials

## Dependencies
- Cloud provider accounts or on-premises infrastructure
- CI/CD pipeline for infrastructure deployment
- Secrets management system
- Monitoring and alerting systems
- Documentation system

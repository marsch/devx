# CI/CD Pipeline for Developer Portal

## Description
Establish a comprehensive continuous integration and continuous deployment pipeline for the developer portal to ensure reliable, automated testing and deployment processes.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Automated build process for all components (frontend, backend, documentation)
- Comprehensive test suite execution (unit, integration, end-to-end)
- Code quality and security scanning
- Automated deployment to staging environments
- Approval process for production deployments
- Rollback capabilities for failed deployments
- Notification system for build and deployment status
- Performance testing integration
- Artifact versioning and management
- Environment-specific configuration management

## Technical Notes
- Implement using industry-standard CI/CD tools (GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI, etc.)
- Containerize applications for consistent deployment across environments
- Implement infrastructure validation tests
- Design for parallel execution to minimize pipeline duration
- Implement caching strategies for dependencies and build artifacts
- Ensure secrets management for sensitive configuration

## Dependencies
- Source code repository
- Testing frameworks
- Infrastructure provisioning system
- Notification system
- Container registry

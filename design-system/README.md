# Developer Portal Design System

This design system defines the visual language, interaction patterns, and design principles for the entire developer portal. It ensures a consistent and high-quality user experience across all user interfaces and content.

## Brand Identity Guidelines
- **Logo usage:** Provide clear space around the logo and avoid modifications to proportions or colors. Use the monochrome version on dark backgrounds.
- **Color palette:** Primary brand color is `#4B6EAF`. Secondary colors include `#2D3748` for text, `#EDF2F7` for backgrounds, and accent colors `#38B2AC` and `#ECC94B`.
- **Typography:** Use "Inter" for headings and "Roboto" for body text. Font weights: 700 for headings, 400 for body. Maintain legibility at all breakpoints.

## Design Principles and Philosophy
- **Clarity:** Prioritize clear communication and straightforward navigation.
- **Consistency:** Components and interactions behave the same across the portal.
- **Efficiency:** Reduce friction for developers by minimizing steps to accomplish tasks.
- **Accessibility:** Follow WCAG AA standards for all components and content.

## Visual Design Language
- **Spacing scale:** Base spacing unit is 4px. Apply multiples of this unit for margins and padding.
- **Color usage:** Use primary color for calls to action, secondary text color for body copy, and accent colors sparingly for highlights.
- **Typography scale:** Establish a modular scale using 1.25 ratio (e.g., 14px, 18px, 22px, 28px).
- **Elevation and shadows:** Use subtle shadows to signify layering. Avoid excessive elevation.

## Interaction Patterns and Behavior
- **Buttons:** Primary buttons use the brand color and contain short, action-oriented labels. Disabled buttons have 40% opacity and no hover state.
- **Forms:** Label fields clearly and show inline validation errors. Use logical tab order and support keyboard navigation.
- **Navigation:** Keep global navigation persistent at the top. Collapse into a hamburger menu on mobile.
- **Feedback:** Provide confirmation messages for actions, and use toast notifications for transient updates.

## Voice and Tone
- **Voice:** Friendly, straightforward, and professional.
- **Tone:** Adjust tone based on context—informative for documentation, encouraging for onboarding, and concise for errors.
- **Style:** Use active voice, short sentences, and avoid jargon unless defined.

## Accessibility Guidelines
- Follow [WCAG 2.1 AA](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) standards.
- Ensure sufficient color contrast (minimum 4.5:1 for text).
- Provide text alternatives for all non-text content.
- Support full keyboard navigation and visible focus states.

## Responsive Design
- **Breakpoints:**
  - `sm` – 640px
  - `md` – 768px
  - `lg` – 1024px
  - `xl` – 1280px
- **Behavior:** Stack columns vertically on smaller screens. Use responsive typography and images. Ensure tappable targets are at least 44px by 44px.

## Animation and Transition Specifications
- Use animations sparingly to provide context or feedback.
- Standard transition duration is 150ms for UI interactions.
- Use "ease-in-out" timing for most transitions.
- Avoid animations that flash or rapidly change colors to reduce motion sickness.

## Iconography System
- Icons should share a consistent stroke width and corner radius.
- Use a 24px grid for designing icons.
- Ensure icons are recognizable at small sizes and include accessible labels.

## Design File Templates and Component Libraries
- Maintain master design files in Figma (or your preferred design tool) with components for buttons, forms, navigation, cards, and other UI elements.
- Provide template pages for key layouts (e.g., docs page, dashboard, marketing page).
- Share component libraries with development teams to ensure design-to-code alignment.

## Technical Implementation Notes
- **Design tokens:** Store color, typography, and spacing tokens in a JSON format. Example:
  ```json
  {
    "colorPrimary": "#4B6EAF",
    "fontFamilyHeading": "Inter",
    "spacingBase": "4px"
  }
  ```
- **Version control:** Keep design assets in a dedicated branch or repository and tag releases using semantic versioning (e.g., `v1.0.0`).
- **Design-to-code workflow:** Automate export of design tokens to your codebase. Use pull requests for updates and review.
- **Decision-making documentation:** Record rationale for major design choices in a changelog or design journal.
- **Governance:** Establish a design system owner and review board. Allow contributions via proposals with clear acceptance criteria.
- **Scalability:** Modularize components and tokens so new features can reuse existing patterns, ensuring consistent growth.

Developer Portal: Comprehensive Implementation Guide
1. Project Overview & Objectives
   Goal: Build an open-source, production-ready developer portal for API consumers (external partners/public), with:

Admin UI

Consumer UI (developer dashboard)

Okta (OIDC) for authentication/identity

Kong API Gateway for key provisioning, rate limits, analytics

Stripe for monetization

Beautiful docs for OpenAPI/Swagger and GraphQL (interactive, Stripe/Stoplight-style)

Usage analytics, quota management

Stack: TypeScript, Hono (Bun/Node), ideally deployable on Cloudflare Workers

Clean, modern, easily extendable UI (preferably React, shadcn/ui, Tailwind, or similar)

2. Tech Stack and Architectural Decisions
   Backend/API
   Framework: Hono (runs on Bun/Node/Cloudflare Workers)

Language: TypeScript

Hosting: Cloudflare Workers (preferred, else Node/Bun server for local/dev)

Persistence: Cloudflare D1 (SQLite on edge), KV for configs/static, Durable Objects for high-consistency, or external DB as fallback

API Gateway: Kong (self-hosted or Kong Konnect Cloud)

Identity: Okta (OIDC/OAuth2, externalized credentials)

Payments: Stripe API

Frontend
UI Framework: React (preferred for ecosystem and interactivity)

Styling: TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui for components (ensures modern look and easy customization)

Docs:

REST: Stoplight Elements or Redoc

GraphQL: GraphiQL, DociQL

Guides/Markdown: MDX or Markdown renderer

3rd Party Services
Email: Postmark/SendGrid/Mailgun (optional, for invites and alerts)

Analytics: Moesif (optional, for advanced analytics), else roll basic usage metrics

DevOps: GitHub Actions (CI), Wrangler CLI (Cloudflare), Prettier/ESLint, OpenAPI linting, CodeQL scanning for security

3. Development Process & Best Practices
   A. Foundation
   Setup Monorepo

Use pnpm or yarn workspaces for monorepo with clear separation:

/apps/portal-backend (Hono API)

/apps/portal-frontend (React UI)

/packages/shared (types, utils)

/infrastructure (deployment scripts, worker configs)

Environment & Secrets

Use .env for local secrets (Okta, Stripe, Kong admin URLs, etc.)

In prod, leverage Cloudflare’s environment variable system or secret stores

Never commit secrets; use .env.example for contributors

Testing & Linting

Prettier, ESLint (TypeScript config)

Vitest or Jest for unit/integration tests

Playwright or Cypress for E2E tests

Setup basic CI workflow early (GitHub Actions: lint, typecheck, test, build)

B. Code Quality & Collaboration
Type-First: Use TypeScript for everything, type your APIs and DB models, generate OpenAPI docs/types from source if possible.

Modularity: Organize code into services/modules (auth, billing, docs, admin) for separation of concerns.

Extensibility: Expose core interfaces for integration points (e.g., “keyProvisioner” for gateways, “paymentProvider” for billing) to allow future contributors to swap modules.

Documentation:

Always document public methods, modules, and config options.

Use a /docs folder for architecture, API, deployment, and “how to contribute” guides.

Open Source Hygiene:

Add a CONTRIBUTING.md early, explain branching model, PR review, code style, and how to run locally.

Add a CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md.

Use issues/discussions for roadmap and user feedback.

Accessibility & Theming: Use accessible components, ARIA where needed; provide theming (light/dark mode).

Internationalization: Optional, but plan for i18n-ready UI (using i18next or similar).

4. Major Milestones/Phases & Functional Packages
   Phase 1: Scaffolding & Core
   Setup repo, monorepo structure, and continuous integration

Implement basic Hono server with healthcheck

Deploy Hello World on Cloudflare Workers

Scaffold React frontend (with Vite, shadcn/ui, Tailwind)

Ensure local + preview environments work end-to-end

Phase 2: Authentication & User Management
Integrate Okta OIDC: login/logout, token validation, user sessions (JWT, signed cookie)

Build minimal user store (Cloudflare D1): Okta ID, roles, invite codes, application links

Implement invite-only flow (admin can generate invites, users redeem)

Role-based UI (admin/dev, restrict admin routes)

Frontend: login/logout flows, “my account”, “invite code” handling

Phase 3: API Catalog & Documentation
Define schema/model for APIs (name, type, docs URL, plans, etc.)

Admin UI: add/edit APIs, upload OpenAPI/GraphQL schema

Public UI: show catalog, API details page

Integrate Stoplight Elements or Redoc for OpenAPI docs rendering

Integrate GraphiQL (or DociQL-generated static) for GraphQL docs

Add Markdown/MDX guides, quick start, changelog support

Docs search, version switching for APIs

Phase 4: API Key Management & Kong Integration
Connect to Kong Admin API

Implement flows to create Kong consumer for user, generate key (key-auth/JWT/OAuth)

Store key metadata (never show secrets after first reveal)

UI: manage keys (create, revoke, label), show per-application

Assign consumers to plans/groups (ACL, rate limit plugin via Kong)

Sync user/API access states between portal and Kong

Security: never expose Kong admin credentials in frontend

Phase 5: Plans, Quotas, & Monetization
Admin UI: define plans (quota, rate, pricing), link to Kong policy config

Integrate Stripe for subscriptions (Checkout, Billing Portal, webhook handler in backend)

User UI: see plan, subscribe/upgrade/cancel

Enforce plan selection for API key issuance

Handle quota limits in Kong via plugin per plan/user

Stripe webhook: sync subscription state, handle overages, alerts

Phase 6: Usage Analytics & Monitoring
Choose: Moesif integration, or roll basic usage stats (calls/day, errors, etc.)

Backend: collect, aggregate, and expose analytics (per-user, per-key, per-API)

Frontend: show dashboards/charts for users (my usage) and admins (global usage)

Alerting: send emails on approaching quota/overages (via Postmark/SendGrid)

Phase 7: Admin Dashboard & Support Tools
Admin UI: user management (search, reset, deactivate, impersonate), plan assignment, invite mgmt

API management (edit docs, plans, visibility)

Support: integrate contact form or link to external community (Discord/GitHub)

Release notes/changelog for API updates

Phase 8: Polish & OSS Readiness
Theming (brand logo/colors), responsive design, accessibility review

Write /docs: architecture, setup, contributing, extending

Ship 1-click Cloudflare Worker deploy script (wrangler.toml, README example)

Final security review: secrets, headers, auth, input validation

Announce on GitHub, invite first contributors

5. Development Best Practices
   General
   Start with API contracts first (OpenAPI for backend/frontend, GraphQL SDL if needed)

Interface over implementation: Use TypeScript interfaces for key components

Fail fast and visibly: Proper error handling/logging, bubble up user-friendly errors

Minimal state in Workers: Store persistent state in D1/KV; never rely on in-memory state in Cloudflare Workers

Environment-driven config: All secrets/URLs in environment variables, documented in .env.example

Security-first:

All sensitive tokens/keys only visible on create (never again)

Use Zod or similar for input validation

Enforce HTTPS (Cloudflare Workers default), secure cookies, CORS as needed

RBAC everywhere – always check user role on sensitive endpoints

Frontend
Modern UI kit: shadcn/ui or similar for rapid development and polish

SSR/static for docs: Use static rendering for documentation where possible for SEO and perf

Error boundaries, loading states: User feedback is crucial in API portals

Code splitting: Lazy load heavy doc components (e.g., Stoplight/Redoc/GraphiQL)

Integration
Kong: Use its Admin API only from backend, never frontend; securely manage API tokens

Okta: Use OIDC libraries (e.g., openid-client), keep user session short-lived

Stripe: Use webhooks for billing state; never trust the frontend for payment status

Docs tooling: Bundle static OpenAPI/GraphQL docs when possible; render on the fly if needed

Open Source/Community
Contribution-ready: All code well-documented; issue templates; good README and roadmap

Tests for all modules: Especially on critical paths (auth, key generation, billing)

Simple dev onboarding: Single pnpm install, single pnpm dev for both UI/API

Feature flags: Allow disabling monetization/billing for users who want free/open deployments

Pluggability: Clearly document how to replace key modules (IDP, billing, analytics)

Summary for the Agent
Prioritize: Auth, key management, docs, and analytics first. Monetization, polish, and extra features next.

Build modularly: So each major integration (IDP, gateway, billing) is swappable.

Document and test: For every public API/feature, add docs and tests.

OSS mindset: Make onboarding and contribution as easy as possible.
